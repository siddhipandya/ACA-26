  <h1> Biography</h1>
  <p> First of all, his is an inspirational story. The lads from the Urban cities like Delhi and Mumbai ruled cricket in India. MS hailed from a small town and reached at the helm of affairs. The desire to represent his nation kept him going despite all the troubles. And here he stands as the best leader the country has ever seen.
    Why MS Dhoni biography became so famous because his story has everything from struggle, turning points, hard work, love, passion, success etc. That’s the reason why the movie made on him in Bollywood turned out to be a blockbuster.</p>
<p>
Initially, it wasn’t cricket that MS turned to. He was the goalkeeper of his school’s football team, DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir. One day, to fill in for the wicketkeeper of the cricket team, the coach sent him as a replacement. That was the turning point in his life. After that Dhoni adapted cricket and cricket adopted Dhoni.</p>
<p>
His impressive performances as a wicketkeeper as well as a batsman gave him a prominent slot in the Commando cricket club team. He kept climbing ladders of success as a teenager. He went on to play Ranji for Bihar in 1999-2000. Dhoni scored an unbeaten 68 in his debut game. Then notched up a hundred against Bengal in the next season.</p>
    <p>
      He featured in his debut game and got run out for a duck. The whole series didn’t yield fruitful results but the selectors showed faith in him and gave him another go for the ODI series against Pakistan. The rivalry between India and Pakistan is the one that the whole world watches with keen eyes.

There couldn’t be a better stage for MS Dhoni and he pounced on the opportunity and announced his arrival in the game of cricket. In Visakhapatnam, Ganguly promoted him to bat at No.3 for the first time. He scored a magnificent 148 off just 123 balls that included 15 fours and 4 towering sixes. India scored a massive 356 and thumped the neighbors by 58 runs.

After that, another explosion from Dhoni’s bat came against Sri Lanka when he scored 183 runs, his highest ODI score till date. Very rapidly, he built a reputation of being a power hitter. But contrary to that, he later made a mark batting down the order when he finished matches for India. In short, there was no stopping MS Dhoni as he rose to the top of Indian cricket in no time.</p>
